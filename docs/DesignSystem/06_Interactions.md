# ✨ Interactions & Animations

## Unique Patterns
1. **Command Palette (Ctrl+K)**: Quick-access overlay for power users.
2. **Drag-and-Drop Incident Workflow**: Incidents move across "Open → Investigating → Resolved".
3. **Incident Replay Mode**: Time-lapse playback of incident lifecycle.

## Animations
- Hover: Icons rotate 5° or shift up 2px.
- Loading: Pulsing waveform animation (instead of spinners).
- Timeline: Animated progression dots.

✅ Do:
- Keep animations under 300ms for responsiveness.
- Use easing curves (`ease-in-out`).

❌ Don’t:
- Add distracting, looping animations to dashboards.
